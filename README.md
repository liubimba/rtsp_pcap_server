# rtsp-pcap-server

An RTSP server in Java that serves **any pcap capture** by replaying the RTP inside it — no
encoder involved.

Point it at a capture. It works out what streams are in there, describes them to the client, and
replays each packet at the moment the capture says it belongs.

```bash
mvn package
java --enable-preview -jar target/rtsp-pcap-server-0.0.1.jar \
  --pcap bunny.pcapng --map 97:H264/90000 --map 96:mpeg4-generic/12000/2
ffplay rtsp://localhost:5554/bunny
```

## Why replay instead of encode

A normal RTSP server encodes video on the fly: it needs an encoder, burns CPU, and emits a
slightly different bitstream every run. That makes it awkward to test against.

Replaying a capture inverts those trade-offs:

- **Deterministic** — every run emits the same RTP bytes, so client bugs reproduce reliably.
- **No encoder** — no FFmpeg pipeline, no codec dependencies, no CPU cost.
- **Real traffic** — actual captured packets, quirks and all, not what a generator invented.
- **Whatever you captured** — a camera, a conference, the stream that misbehaved once at 3am.

It makes a useful fixture for RTSP/RTP client work: point a player at it and you get a stable,
repeatable stream.

## What it works out on its own, and what it cannot

Read from the capture, no help needed:

- how many RTP streams there are, and which port each was delivered to
- each stream's payload type and SSRC
- which packets are RTP, as opposed to the RTCP and strays sharing the capture
- the exact timing of every packet

**Not in the capture, and not guessable:** the codec behind a *dynamic* payload type (96–127).
Those numbers mean whatever the original session's SDP said they meant, and that SDP is not in
the packets. Rather than guess and hand a client a stream it will decode into noise, the server
says what it needs:

```
$ java -jar target/rtsp-pcap-server-0.0.1.jar --pcap bunny.pcapng
payload type 97 is dynamic, so the capture cannot say what codec it is.
Supply it, for example: --map 97:H264/90000
```

Static payload types (0–34) are assigned globally by [RFC 3551][rfc3551] and are named from that
registry automatically — a G.711 capture needs no `--map` at all.

## Usage

```
--pcap <file>        capture to serve (required)
--port <n>           RTSP port to listen on (default 5554)
--name <text>        session name in the SDP (default: the capture's file name)
--map <pt>:<enc>     encoding for a dynamic payload type, e.g. --map 97:H264/90000
--fmtp <pt>:<params> format parameters for a payload type
--sdp <file>         use this session description verbatim instead of building one
--help               show this message
```

Some depacketisers need more than an encoding name: AAC over `mpeg4-generic` cannot be parsed at
all without its `fmtp`, and H.264 needs `packetization-mode` before it will reassemble fragments.
Serving the bundled capture in full:

```bash
java --enable-preview -jar target/rtsp-pcap-server-0.0.1.jar --pcap bunny.pcapng \
  --map 97:H264/90000 --map 96:mpeg4-generic/12000/2 \
  --fmtp 97:'packetization-mode=1;profile-level-id=42C01E;sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LAHtkDxWhAAAADAEAAAAwDxYuS,aMuMsg==' \
  --fmtp 96:'profile-level-id=1;mode=AAC-hbr;sizelength=13;indexlength=3;indexdeltalength=3;config=1490'
```

It reports what it found on startup, so a surprise shows up before a client trips over it:

```
Found 2 RTP stream(s):
  trackID=1  port 49190  payload type 97  ssrc 2093403070  1052 packets
  trackID=2  port 49188  payload type 96  ssrc 2066936511  368 packets
Serving rtsp://localhost:5554/bunny
```

## How it works

                    └── SdpBuilder ───────▶ SDP          how do I describe it?

```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Capture` | the only thing that touches libpcap; the rest works on plain bytes |
| `UdpFrame` | finds the UDP payload, computing offsets per frame rather than assuming them |
| `RtpTrack` | one stream — port, payload type, SSRC — plus the RFC 3551 registry |
| `CaptureAnalyzer` | groups packets into streams, drops RTCP and strays |
| `SdpBuilder` | describes the streams, and refuses to guess a dynamic payload type |
| `ReplayClock` | when each packet is due |
| `RtspHeaders` | reads RTSP fields by name, since [RFC 2326][rfc2326] fixes no header order |
| `Options` | the command line |

Three details worth calling out:

**Offsets are computed, not assumed.** Captures off real networks carry IPv4 options and 802.1Q
tags, both of which move the payload. A fixed offset works right up until it silently reads the
wrong bytes.

**Tracks are identified by `trackID`, not by SETUP order.** The control URL says which stream a
SETUP means, so a client that sets its tracks up out of order still gets each one on the right
port.

**Pacing uses absolute deadlines.** The first packet anchors the clock; every later one is due at
that anchor plus the gap recorded in the capture. A packet that goes out late never pushes back
the ones behind it, so lateness cannot compound.

## Running

Needs JDK 21 and libpcap. jnetpcap resolves `libpcap.so`, which on Debian/Ubuntu ships with the
dev package:

```bash
sudo apt install libpcap-dev
```

```bash
mvn package     # builds target/rtsp-pcap-server-0.0.1.jar with its dependencies in target/lib
mvn test        # 67 tests, none of which need libpcap
```

`--enable-preview` is needed at startup because the Foreign Function & Memory API the capture
reader uses is still a preview feature on Java 21.

## Tech

- **Java 21** — `java.lang.foreign` for reading packet buffers out of native memory
- **jnetpcap-wrapper 2.3.1+jdk21** — libpcap bindings (the plain `2.3.x` artifacts target Java 22
  and will not load on 21)
- **Maven**, **JUnit 5**

## Verified against

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` negotiate both tracks of the bundled capture and decode them as
`h264 240x160 24 fps` and `aac (LC) 12000 Hz stereo`, with no depacketiser errors.

Replaying that capture's 1420 media packets takes **38.89 s** against the **38.73 s** their own
timestamps span — the original timing reproduced to within **0.4%**.

## Scope and limitations

A focused test tool, not a production media server. Deliberately out of scope:

- **One client at a time** — a single RTSP session on one connection.
- **Ethernet + IPv4 + UDP only** — IPv6, tunnelling and other link types are skipped rather than
  guessed at.
- **No RTCP** — sender reports and receiver feedback are not implemented.
- **No seeking** — `PLAY` resumes where the capture left off; `Range` is ignored.
- **RTP passes through verbatim** — sequence numbers and timestamps are the capture's own and are
  not rewritten, so a client strict about SSRC or clock continuity may object.
